Results in the project from analysis in R using DESeq 

The 3 files 

significant_genes_24h, significant_genes_30min, significant_genes_6h

can be uploaded to biocyc.org for generating the metabolic pathways 

The pathways were compared with the processed data (choosing the genes with pvalue(adjusted) < 0.05) from the original study
